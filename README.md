# SIP + SWP Wealth Lifecycle Planner

This project is a browser-based wealth planning simulator that models the full investment lifecycle — from systematic investing (SIP) to systematic withdrawals (SWP).

Most calculators online stop at showing the final corpus value. This tool goes further. It simulates month-by-month portfolio growth, allows withdrawals during retirement, and helps you understand how long your money can realistically last.

The entire application runs client-side using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## What This Project Solves

Investors often ask:

* If I invest ₹X every month, how much will I accumulate?
* After retirement, how much can I withdraw safely?
* Will my corpus continue to grow while I withdraw?
* How long will my money last?
* How does inflation impact sustainability?

This planner answers those questions using month-level simulations instead of simplified final-value formulas.
